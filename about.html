       <center><p id=text5>Salieri Jay, a veritable icon with over five decades of experience in the industry, has become a legend himself, with twenty one successful fine dining restaurants in the world bearing
       his name. Building a solid reputation on the strength of his service and exacting standards, Jay hand selects all sides of beef served in his steakhouses, and chooses only USDA Prime Black Angus beef for flavor and texture.
       A ritual with an artisan’s flair, the beef is dry-aged on premise to perfection, and then carved to order by our own butcher into Salieri’s Fine Dining signature Porterhouse, Prime New York Sirloin, Rib Eye, and Filet Mignon. The results are luxurious - meltingly tender and juicy steaks served sizzling hot with a perfectly caramelized crust.
      <br><br>Salieri’s Fine Dining’s menu has something to please every palate with their famous mouth-watering steaks, and other excellent entree selections including lamb, sashimi grade tuna, fresh Norwegian salmon, Maine lobsters, and more. Salieri’s Fine Dining  classic side offerings such as Creamed Spinach and German Potatoes complement any meal, and tempting appetizers such as Shrimp and Lobster
      Cocktails, Fresh Oysters on the Half Shell, Sizzling Canadian Bacon, and crisp, fresh salads are the perfect prelude to any main course.</p>
